# tracker
Track your devices at a glance with total ownership of your data; a FOSS, self-hosted alternative to Apple's Find My.

## Installation

You'll need Python installed to run the server.

First, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/eskaliert680/tracker.git
cd tracker
```

then install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r dependencies.txt
```

Now you'll need to set up a Supabase project.
